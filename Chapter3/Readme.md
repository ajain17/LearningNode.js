**Express.js**
----------

It is built on top of Node.js. You can use any templating engines and CSS pre-processors. We are going to use [ejs](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) here.
The templating engines allows us to use static template files and at runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

**Create the project**

We will use express-generator to scaffold a new express application. You can install it globally since you donâ€™t need to deploy this as part of your package.json.
First, install all the packages mentioned in the package.json.

    npm install

To scaffold an express project, run `express myProject --view=ejs`
Express uses Jade as the templating engine by default. By using the --view parameter, we are explicitly specifying that we want to use ejs.
This further creates a package.json file inside your myProject so you need to run
 `cd myProject && npm install`

If you notice the package.json file just created inside myProject, you'll see it has

    "start": "node ./bin/www"
The ./bin/www file has all the boilerplate for creating and running an http server. This is the benefit of scaffolding.

Now, let's understand the project structure.

 1. utilities : this has our tracker.js code which is exported as the module.
 2. routes : this contains mapping for each route and the logic to be executed when a route is requested.
 3. views : the route mappings in routes directory renders a view after processing the request. They may pass objects to the views which are plugged in the template using `<%= myVariable %>`. The html/template to be rendered is stored in the views directory.

Now comes the most important part, how does express handles requests?

Let me introduce you to **Request Processing Middleware.**

We are using app.use(.....) to add middleware to our application. The order here is important. For each request, express.js invoked these middleware functions in order. Each function can do two things:

 1. Process the request and send back the response and end the processing of this request.
 2. (Do some processing - optional and ) Delegate the handling of the request to another middleware by calling next().

The error handling middleware is invoked when next(..anything..) is called with a parameter. `next(new Error('Page not found'));` The error handling function can again do any of the above mentioned two things - send response or delegate.

Take a look at the code to see how we have used all of these components in our application. To run the project, just use `npm start`.
